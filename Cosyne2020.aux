The classical gradient descent learning rule follows the contour lines of the error function, whereas the natural gradient rule updates synapses in direction of the target.{\bf  (G)} Learning curves for natural and Euclidean descent learning. The natural gradient shows faster learning compared to the classical error learning rule. {\bf  (H)-(K)} Direction of homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity in a simple experiment with variable excitatory input and tonic inhibition. We stimulated \num {5} out of ten afferents providing excitatory Poisson input at to a neuron, while simultaneously delivering tonic inhibition and a teacher spike train. We investigated the direction of synaptic changes at stimulated and unstimulated synapses as a function of the initial weights.{\bf  (I)} Weight change of stimulated weights. While varying the size of the unstimulated weights had no effect, increasing the initial weight of the simulated synapses resulted in a change from potentation to depression. {\bf  (J)} Weight change of the unstimulated weights. Heterosynaptic plasticity decreased the unstimulated weights in regions where the stimulated weights underwent LTP. Increasing the size of initial stimulated weights resulted in a change to potentiation at the same point where homosynaptic LTP turned into LTD. Further increase of either unstimulated or stimulated weights resulted eventually lead to depression of the unstimulated synapses. {\bf  (K)} Example traces of absolute EPSP amplitude change at the dendrite, for a distal (purple) and a proximal synapse (red) with the same impact on output firing.{\bf  (L)} Absolute dendritic amplitude change as a function of distance from soma is linearly increasing. The synaptic weight traces in {\bf  (M)} show a higher weight change for low variance input compared to high USP variance scenarios.{\bf  (N)} Synaptic weight change on the interval as a function of USP variance.\relax }}{2}\protected@file@percent }
