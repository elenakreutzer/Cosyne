Receiving Poisson spike trains from afferent nerve cells, a neuron had to respond by firing spikes according to a target distribution. The latter was delivered via spikes from a teacher neuron that received the same input. The firing rate of the student neuron depended via a transfer function $\phi $ on the somatic membrane potential $V$, whose elevation above rest was determined by the sum of the synaptic inputs.{\bf  (B-D)} Spike trains, for teacher (orange) and student (red) neuron. ({\bf  (B)} before learning, {\bf  (C)} after learning with the natural gradient rule).{\bf  {(E-G)}} Contour lines of the $D_\mathrm  {KL}$ between output and target distribution and normalized vector plots for Euclidean gradient vectors{\bf  (E)} and natural gradient vectors {\bf  (F)} together with weight path during learning. The classical error learning rule based on Euclidean gradient descent follows the contour lines of the error function, whereas the natural gradient rule updates synapses in direction of the target.{\bf  (G)} Learning curves for natural and Euclidean descent learning, averaged over \num {500} trials with initial and target weights randomly chosen. The natural gradient shows faster learning compared to the classical error learning rule. Fixed learning rates were tuned for each algorithm separately to exhibit the fastest possible convergence.{\bf  (H)} Direction of homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity in a simple experiment with variable excitatory input and tonic inhibition. We stimulated \num {5} out of ten afferents providing excitatory Poisson input at \SI {5}{\hertz } to a neuron, while simultaneously delivering tonic inhibition and a teacher spike train at \SI {20}{\hertz }. We investigated the direction of synaptic changes at stimulated and unstimulated synapses as a function of the initial weights.{\bf  (I)} Weight change of stimulated weights. While varying the size of the unstimulated weights has no effect, increasing the initial weight of the simulated synapses results in a change from potentation to depression, once the postsynaptic error term becomes negative.{\bf  (J)} Weight change of the unstimulated weights. Heterosynaptic plasticity decreased the unstimulated weights in regions where the stimulated weights underwent LTP. Increasing the size of initial stimulated weights resulted in a change to potentiation at the same point where homosynaptic LTP turned into LTD. Further increase of either unstimulated or stimulated weights resulted eventually lead to depression of the unstimulated synapses. {\bf  (K)} Example traces of absolute EPSP amplitude change at the dendrite, for $d=\SI {3}{\micro \meter }$ and $d=\SI {7}{\micro \meter }$.{\bf  (L)} Absolute dendritic amplitude change as a function of distance from soma is linearly increasing. The synaptic weight traces in {\bf  (M)} show a higher weight change for low variance input compared to high USP variance scenarios.{\bf  (N)} Synaptic weight change on the interval as a function of USP variance.\relax }}{3}\protected@file@percent }
